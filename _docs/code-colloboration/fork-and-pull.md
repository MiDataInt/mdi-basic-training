There are various collaboration models that a project can use
for developers to work together on code. A project will
declare its model and stick with it.  The MDI uses the collaboration
model generally known as "Fork & Pull" or the "Forking Workflow".

## Open Source Code Projects

Understanding the Fork & Pull collaboration model requires a basic
understanding of Open Source software, which means that the 
code for a project is publicly available for others to see and use
(according to license declarations that are beyond the scope of 
this tutorial). In the context of GitHub, this means that a developer
has set the status of a code repository to "Public". 

As an example, the code for this Basic Training is a public GitHub repo
distributed according to the MIT license.

## Learn the Basics

As always, there are many internet resources to help you understand
forking and pulling into a git code repository.

The concepts you will want to understand are that:

- Project maintainers control the code in the "official", "definitive" repository
- Code developers:
    - fork a copy of the repo to their own GitHub account
    - clone their fork of the code to their local computer
    - edit code toward some purpose
    - push their changes to their fork, in their own GitHub account
    - make a "pull request" to the project maintainers to have their code incorporated into the definitive repository

If you are still fuzzy after reading above, no worries, the next Exercise
will walk you throught these steps.
