Now that you have an account on an HPC server, you need to access it
from your desktop or laptop computer. There are many ways to do this,
and you may already have your own preferences. We will cover two approaches: 

- web-based access via the Open OnDemand platform
- access via SSH from within VS Code

Each approach has its strengths and you may
find yourself using both for different reasons.

UMich Advanced Research Computing (ARC)
has additional information on some alternative access tools
like Putty and FileZilla:
