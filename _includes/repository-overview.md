_{{ site.title }}_ provides tutorials and links to resources to help beginners build
essential skills for participating in MDI code development

Folders in this repository contain ordered tasks for you to work through. 
Start at the beginning and follow the instructions on each tab at the left.

Some steps end with you making a Pull Request to this or another repository. 
We will get a message to review your work and will let you know if you are ready 
to move on to the next steps.

Completing these tasks is optional (unless you are a student working on the 
MDI Project). You will find one or all of them easy if you 
are an experienced developer, in which case you can go directly to CONTRIBUTING.md 
in one of the other repositories in the MiDataInt organization.
