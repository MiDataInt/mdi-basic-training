GitHub is a public web server that helps developers 
store, manage and share their code projects. It is the most 
common server used for people working on Open Source software
projects, where many developers work on the same code.

A common confusion for beginners is to think that Git and GitHub
are the "same thing". They are not. Git is a code versioning 
system - you do not need to use GitHub to use Git. GitHub
is a public code resource that uses Git (there are others like
GitLab and BitBucket, but the MDI uses GitHub).
