To work on a remote HPC server you must have access to one.

The MDI basic training is written for people at the University of Michigan,
so instructions here are specific to our 
[Great Lakes server cluster](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/). 

Minor modifications would allow you to use any other Linux server 
in a similar fashion, at your institution, on a cloud server provider, etc.

### Get a Great Lakes account

Please visit the UMich Advanced Research Computing (ARC) web site 
for information on getting a login and user account for Great Lakes.

You will eventually also need access to a Slurm account for charging
your work, which we will cover in a later section. 

In general, you need to be working as part of a research or other team
with a prinicipal investigator or project leader who will know
how to get you the permissions you need.
