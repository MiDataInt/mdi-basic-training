**{{ site.title }}** provides information and links to resources to 
help beginners build essential skills for participating in MDI code 
use and  development.

### Learn about the MDI

To begin, you might want to improve your understanding of what the
MDI seeks to achieve and how it can benefit you. 
Please use the links at the bottom of this page. 
Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet - come back and start 
working through this Basic Training.

### Exercises

Some pages contain practical exercises to work through. 
Completing these tasks is optional (unless you are a student working on the 
MDI Project). You will find them easy if you 
are an experienced developer, in which case you can go directly to 
learning about and using the MDI.

In the exercises, we will provide essential information and structured
tasks, but we will not spoonfeed every command to you verbatim.
We expect you to quickly start _learning how to learn_ to code, 
which means you have to read documentation and use the internet
to discover things for yourself. When you get stuck, ask!
