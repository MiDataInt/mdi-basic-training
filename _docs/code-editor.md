## {{ page.title }}

A developer must edit code, for which you
will need a **code editor**, i.e., a program to help you author code
in the same way that Microsoft Word helps you author documents.

A good code editor does more than allow you to type.
It helps you write accurate, working code without bugs,
to follow best practices of code style, to quickly see
the results of your work, and more.

People speak of using an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**,
where a code editor is one part of the IDE's set of tools
for code development. We don't need to worry about exactly what 
makes an "editor" become an "IDE".

## Visual Studio Code

There are many editors/IDEs and you may already 
have a preference. You don't need to switch if you 
use Atom, R Studio, Komodo or something else. However, the "official"
editor/IDE used by the MDI is **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** and you will have
the best experience integrating with others if you use it. It is 
the most common editor in use today and well supported.

> Students working on the MDI project are expected to use VS Code.

### Install VS Code

You'll find everything you need to get started with VS Code here:

<https://code.visualstudio.com/>

>When you install VS Code, you will have a chance to choose your color
>theme. If you are new to writing code, hardcore developers tend to use 
>dark themes, but it is your choice.

### Extensions

VS Code is a fully functioning editor "out of the box", but it
can be enhanced by various "Extensions". To see the extensions that are
already installed, click on the Extensions icon in the leftmost panel of VS Code.

Depending on what you will work on in the MDI, you will find certain extensions 
to be very useful. We'll mention these again when you need them, but it
won't hurt you to find and install them now. Here's a good list to start with. 

- **Remote - SSH**, by Microsoft
- **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**, by GitHub
- **Code Spell Checker**, by Street Side Software 
- **R**, by REditorSupport  
- **YAML**, by Red Hat  
- **perl-syntax**, by Jack Karamanian  

> There are often many extensions for the same languages, be sure to get the exact ones mentioned above.
