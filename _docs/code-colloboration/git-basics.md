## Git

When you work on a project, it is essential to have a way
of tracking changes you make to your codebase, to help you follow
what you've done and even go back in time. We'll call this process
"version control" (even if we don't give version numbers to every change).

**Git** is the most common version control system in use today, and the
solution used by the MDI. Git allows you to:

- keep multiple versions of a codebase
- work on the same code as someone else, at the same time
- keep your code safe and secure against accidental deletion, etc.
- work on a development version without disturbing production code
- and more!

## Learn the Basics

There are many resources on the internet to introduce you to the basic
concepts of Git, take a look through the ones you find most useful:

## Install Git (and Git Bash) Locally

Generally speaking, you are encouraged to write code on your 
local computer (e.g., desktop or laptop) using VS Code. It isn't 
strictly necessary for you to install Git
to do this as its functionality is built into VS Code. However,
there are various reasons you might find it useful to have Git installed,
including that it provides the Git Bash command line utility on Windows.

You can install (Git and Git Bash) from here:
