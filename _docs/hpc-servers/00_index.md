Because Stage 1 pipelines entail handling of large files
and computationally intensive data analysis steps,
in general they are executed on a remote, Linux-based,
High Performance Computing (HPC) server cluster.
As a result, it is often best to develop pipeline
code within such a server environment.

We will also see that MDI web servers are often
run on a remote HPC server to allow Stage 2 apps to easily
access the data files generated by Stage 1 pipelines.

This basic training section will get you up to speed
working on HPC servers and the Linux command line.
